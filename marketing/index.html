		<p>Coaching is a powerful process that enables you to step into your full potential. We all possess the capacity for knowing what is best for ourselves. I am a trained Co-Active coach, and as your coach, I will partner with you to help you reach the goals you set out to achieve.</p>
		<p>In working together you will be guided in thought-provoking and creative approaches. You will garner fresh perspectives, achieve clarity and increase awareness. My role is to encourage, guide, and motivate you through the challenges and opportunities you are facing; and toward the change you want to see. </p>

		<p>At its core my coaching relationships are built on a foundation of trust, openness, authenticity and commitment. </p>
		<p>I truly believe humanity is powerful and only limited by our own perceived limitations. When we as humans realize our own unique purpose, see our true power, fully live our values and step out into the world – great things happen.</p>

		<p>A good coach is someone who is an expert at helping others create positive change in their lives. I will help you explore and come up with the best choices for you based on where you are and your future vision. I do not "fix" or give advice, I focus on your strengths, and changing behaviors to achieve desired outcomes. The coaching relationship is unilateral – it is exclusively focused on you and your goals.</p>

		<p>Coaching sessions are two to four sessions per month, lasting at least 30 minutes and up to 60 minutes.</p>
		<p>One-on-one meetings with clients in an office is possible, but I recommend telephone sessions for the ease of use, minimization of distractions, better privacy, and efficiency.</p>
