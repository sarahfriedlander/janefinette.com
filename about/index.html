		<p>I am a bilingual marketing communications professional who specializes in assisting technology companies, small businesses and startups.</p>
		<p>For the last 10 years of my career I have been fortunate to build out and execute marketing plans that have utilized engagement marketing strategies, email marketing campaigns and social media for: Apple, Adobe, Mozilla Firefox, Seagate and may others.</p>
		<p>Originally from Long Island, and a graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology I have earned my bicoastal badge living in both New York and the San Francisco Bay area, but now am proud to call Santiago de Chile home.</p>

		<p>Santiago provides the perfect blend of many of my passions: a wonderful language, city living and an increasing exciting technology scene. If you would have told me a few years ago that I would be living in South America I probably would’ve laughed but I’m here now and couldn’t be happier!</p>
		<p>Today I am a bilingual marketing consultant, working for a variety of international small businesses and startups located in Australia, Chile and the United States.</p>
		<p>When not working my free time is spent with my husband <a href="http://www.rodrigogarcia.net">Rodrigo</a> and our dog <a href="http://www.sarah.cl/aidan">Aidan</a>. I am a self-professed geek, I love traveling, trying new food, wine tasting, listening to music and meeting new people.
