		<p>I’m a Long Island native, and a graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology, where the weather was dismal, the work was non-ending and snow was a four letter word. After college I relocated to the San Francisco Bay area to pursue my dream of living and breathing all things tech. After 4 years in California I moved to Santiago de Chile, where I reside today.</p>
		<p>Santiago provides the perfect blend of many of my passions: a wonderful language, city living and an increasing exciting technology scene. If you would have told me a few years ago that I would be living in South America I probably would’ve laughed but I’m here now and couldn’t be happier!</p>
		<p>I am always open to hear about new opportunities (communications, marketing, engagement, events, social media and project management are my specialties) so if you think you have something that I will look feel free to drop me a <a href="http://www.sarah.cl/contact">message</a>.</p>

		<p>Currently my days are spent working in marketing, taking Spanish classes, and spending quality time with my dog, Aidan and husband, Rodrigo. I am a self-professed geek, I love traveling, trying new food, wine tasting, listening to music and meeting new people. Take a peek around the site and hopefully you like what you see.</p>
